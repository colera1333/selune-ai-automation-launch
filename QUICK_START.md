### 2.2 Basic Automation Script
Create `automation.py`:

```python
import json
import requests
from datetime import datetime

def scrape_and_package():
    """Basic web scraping + packaging automation"""
    
    # 1. Define your data source
    target_url = "https://example.com/data"
    
    # 2. Process the data (replace with your logic)
    data = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "source": target_url,
        "processed_data": "Your valuable content here"
    }
    
    # 3. Package for delivery
    with open("output.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    
    return "Data processed and packaged!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = scrape_and_package()
    print(result)
```

### 2.3 Test Your Automation
Run: `python automation.py`
